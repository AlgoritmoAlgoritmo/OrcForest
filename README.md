ABOUT THIS
----------

It's a 2D top-down bullet hell I made for the NSFW MiniJam #10.

The development:
----------------

It took me 8 days working as a solo. I wrote all of the code
(except by the effects system), made the characters and 
projectiles sprites, the animations and timelines by myself.


The tools I used:
  * Game Engine: Unity
  * Languages: C#
  * IDE: VisualStudio, Notepad++ (xD)
  * 2D graphic asset editor: Piskel, Gimp


Here are the external packages/resources I used:
  * Music: "Victory from Within" from Vinarco's Music Pack
            (available at Unity asset store)    
  * For the BG: Tiny RPG - Forest (available at Unity asset
            store)  
  * Effect System: Feel (available at Unity asset store)
